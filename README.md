# ubiquitous
A simple minimalistic startpage design based on another one I can't remember right now.

It has a background randomizer and even an image randomizer (disabled by default), that change the background on each time the page is loaded.

## Instalation
Simply download from [here](google.com) and open it locally from your browser.

## Customization
Changing the links is as simple as changing the links itself on the index.html file.

To change the backgrounds/images simply change or add the files in the /bgs and /image folder. 
If you want more images than what are there you have to change the global variables of the random.js file (instructions with more detail in the file).
